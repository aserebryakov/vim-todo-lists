TODO Items
----------

The sequence matching the expression '^  [ ] ' marks a line as a TODO list
item.

Example
-------

[ ] Not done
[X] Done

Items Hierarchy
---------------

If one item has lesser indentation than the next one then the first one is meant
to be 'parent' and the second to be 'child'.

Example
-------

[ ] Parent
  [ ] Child1
  [ ] Child2

Rules:
* Changing state of the parent item changes the state of all children items accorndantly
* If all children items are marked done, parent will also be marked as done
* If parent is marked as done and one of the children changes state to not done
  parent will also be marked as not done

------------------

Items are highlighted in accordance to the following scheme:

[ ] ! Important item (Underlined)
[ ] Normal item (Normal)
[X] Done item (Comment)

----------------------------

to the following rules

Mark item done
--------------

Item marked as done is moved to the end of all done items list.
If done list doesn't exist, item is placed just after the last not done item.

Before
------

[ ] Not Done 1
[ ] Will be done now
[ ] Not Done 2
[X] Done

After
-----

[ ] Not Done 1
[ ] Not Done 2
[X] Done
[X] Will be done now

Mark item undone
----------------

Undone item is moved to the end of all not done items list.
If all items are marked done, the items is moved before the first done item.

Before
------

[ ] Not Done 1
[ ] Not Done 2
[X] Done
[X] Will be undone now

After
-----

[ ] Not Done 1
