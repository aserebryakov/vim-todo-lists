3. Usage                                                     *VimTodoListsUsage*

Plugin is automatically applied for files named `todo.md` or with the `.todo.md` extension.

TODO Items
----------

The following example represents TODO items definition by default.

Example
-------

- [ ] Not done
- [X] Done

Custom Configuration
--------------------

You can customize the representation of the item by defining the following variables
to your `.vimrc`

let g:VimTodoListsUndoneItem = '- [X]'
let g:VimTodoListsDoneItem = '- [V]'

Important Item
--------------

Important item is defined as 'undone item string !'.

```
- [ ] ! Important item
```

Items Hierarchy
---------------

If one item has lesser indentation than the next one then the first one is meant
to be 'parent' and the second to be 'child'.

Example
-------

- [ ] Parent
  - [ ] Child1
  - [ ] Child2

Rules:
* Changing state of the parent item changes the state of all children items accorndantly
* If all children items are marked done, parent will also be marked as done
* If parent is marked as done and one of the children changes state to not done
  parent will also be marked as not done


Items Highlighting
------------------

Items are highlighted in accordance to the following scheme:

- [ ] ! Important item (Underlined)
- [ ] Normal item (Normal)
- [X] Done item (Comment)


Items moving on state change
----------------------------

By default item when its status is changed is moved in the list in accordance
to the following rules

Mark item done
--------------

Item marked as done is moved to the end of all done items list.
If done list doesn't exist, item is placed just after the last not done item.

Before
------

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Will be done now
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done

After
-----

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done
- [X] Will be done now

Mark item undone
----------------

Undone item is moved to the end of all not done items list.
If all items are marked done, the items is moved before the first done item.

Before
------

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done
- [X] Will be undone now

After
-----

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [ ] Will be done now
- [X] Done

Interaction with items hierarchy
--------------------------------

This feature also affect the items in hierarchy in accordance to the rules above.

Disable the items moving
------------------------

If you don't want items to be moved after state change, you may add the following
line into your .vimrc file:

let g:VimTodoListsMoveItems = 0

		*:VimTodoListsCreateNewItem* *:VimTodoListsGoToNextItem*
		*:VimTodoListsGoToPreviousItem* *:VimTodoListsToggleItem*

  nnoremap <buffer> s :VimTodoListsToggleItem<CR>

  noremap <buffer> <leader>e :silent call VimTodoListsSetItemMode()<CR>
endfunction
