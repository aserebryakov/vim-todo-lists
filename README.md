    $ git clone https://github.com/aserebryakov/vim-todo-lists.git

##### NeoBundle

    NeoBundle 'aserebryakov/vim-todo-lists'

directory.

Usage
-----

Plugin is automatically applied for files named `todo.md` or with the `.todo.md` extension.

##### TODO Items

The following example represents TODO items definition by default.

###### Example

```
- [ ] Not done
- [X] Done
```

###### Custom Configuration

You can customize the representation of the item by defining the following variables
to your `.vimrc`

```
let g:VimTodoListsUndoneItem = '- [X]'
let g:VimTodoListsDoneItem = '- [V]'
```

###### Important Item

Important item is defined as `undone item string !`.

```
- [ ] ! Important item
```

##### Items Hierarchy

If one item has lesser indentation than the next one then the first one is meant
to be **parent** and the second to be **child**.

###### Example

```
- [ ] Parent
  - [ ] Child1
  - [ ] Child2
```

###### Rules:

* Changing state of the parent item changes the state of all children items accordantly
* If all children items are marked done, parent will also be marked as done
* If parent is marked as done and one of the children changes state to not done
  parent will also be marked as not done

##### Items Highlighting

Items are highlighted in accordance to the following scheme:

```
- [ ] ! Important item (Underlined)
- [ ] Normal item (Normal)
- [X] Done item (Comment)
```

##### Items moving on state change

By default item when its status is changed is moved in the list in accordance
to the following rules

###### Mark item done

Item marked as done is moved to the end of all done items list.
If done list doesn't exist, item is placed just after the last not done item.

*Before*

```
- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Will be done now
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done
```

*After*

```
- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done
- [X] Will be done now
```

###### Mark item undone

Undone item is moved to the end of all not done items list.
If all items are marked done, the items is moved before the first done item.

*Before*

```
- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done
- [X] Will be undone now
```
*After*

```
- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [ ] Will be done now
- [X] Done
```

###### Interaction with items hierarchy

This feature also affect the items in hierarchy in accordance to the rules above.

###### Disable the items moving

If you don't want items to be moved after state change, you may add the following
line into your `.vimrc` file:

```
let g:VimTodoListsMoveItems = 0
```

##### Commands

* `:VimTodoListsCreateNewItemAbove` - creates a new item in a line above cursor
* `:VimTodoListsCreateNewItemBelow` - creates a new item in a line below cursor
* `:VimTodoListsCreateNewItem`      - creates a new item in current line
* `:VimTodoListsGoToNextItem`       - go to the next item
* `:VimTodoListsGoToPreviousItem`   - go to the previous item
* `:VimTodoListsToggleItem`         - toggles the current item (or selected items in visual mode)
* `:VimTodoListsIncreaseIndent`     - increases the indent of current line
* `:VimTodoListsDecreaseIndent`     - decreases the indent of current line

##### Default key mappings

###### Item editing mode

* `j` - go to next item
* `k` - go to previous item
* `O` - create new item above the cursor
* `o` - create new item below the cursor
* `<Space>` - toggle current item
* `<CR>` - create new item in `insert mode`
* `<Tab>` - increases the indent of current (or selected) line(s)
* `<Shift-Tab>` - decreases the indent of current (or selected) line(s)
* `<leader>e` - switch to normal editing mode

###### Normal editing mode

* `j`, `k`, `o`, `O`, `<CR>` - no special behavior
* `<Space>` - toggle current item
* `<leader>e` - switch to item editing mode

##### Custom key mappings

The `g:VimTodoListsCustomKeyMapper` variable should contain a name of the function
implementing custom mappings.

###### Example

```
let g:VimTodoListsCustomKeyMapper = 'VimTodoListsCustomMappings'

function! VimTodoListsCustomMappings()
  nnoremap <buffer> s :VimTodoListsToggleItem<CR>
  nnoremap <buffer> <Space> :VimTodoListsToggleItem<CR>
  noremap <buffer> <leader>e :silent call VimTodoListsSetItemMode()<CR>
endfunction
```

##### Automatic date insertion

Automatic date insertion may be enabled by setting the following in `.vimrc`:

```
let g:VimTodoListsDatesEnabled = 1
```

Date format may be changed by setting the format variable to a valid
`strftime()` string:

```
let g:VimTodoListsDatesFormat = "%a %b, %Y"
```
